# BasicMethodsOfExperimentalPhysics_17-18
This repository contains the code that was used in the Basic Methods of Experimental Physics course of the Physics bachelor at the KU Leuven, during the academic year 2017-2018. The course consisted of multiple smaller research projects.

The course was given in Dutch, so all non-code text in the notebooks are written in Dutch as well.
